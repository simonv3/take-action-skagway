Feel like you need to keep up on things that are happening across the world, or want to find ways to take action?

## [WTF Just Happened](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/)

> Warning: this website has a swear word!

A daily list of things that happened nationally. Super useful for quick updates on the state of things.

## [Daily Action](https://dailyaction.org)

After you sign up, Daily Action sends you a thing to call your representatives about every day. If you call their number they will give you a quick update on the topic of the day and why it's important. Than they'll route you to our Senator's offices. This take 5 minutes to do and your voice and opinion gets heard!

## [Wall Of Us](https://www.wall-of-us.org)

A weekly newsletter giving you four actions _and instructions_ to act on during the week. This includes instructions on how to act out a boycott, who to visit and put pressure on, and instructions on calling representatives.

If you ever find any of this information to be out of date, or want to add anything, contact us: [hi@take-action-alaska.org](mailto:hi@take-action-alaska.org).

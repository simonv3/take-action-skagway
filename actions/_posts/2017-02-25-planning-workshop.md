On Saturday the 25th at 10:00am we'll meet in the school's multipurpose room to discuss what we want to achieve next as a community. Whether locally, state-wide, or nationwide - we want everyone at the table to add their voice to this conversation.Â 

If you have something you're passionate about and want to take action on, this will be an opportunity to find like-minded people.

Science, scientists, and evidence-based policymaking are under attack. Budget cuts, censorship of researchers, disappearing datasets, and threats to dismantle government agencies harm us all, putting our health, food, air, water, climate, and jobs at risk. It is time for people who support science to take a public stand and be counted.

The March for Science is the first step of a global movement to defend the vital role science plays in our health, safety, economies, and governments.

We'll be meeting at the Elks (after Clean Sweep) for staging at 1:30 to march around 2:00.

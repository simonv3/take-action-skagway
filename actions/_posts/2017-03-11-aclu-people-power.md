We are hosting a livestream viewing of the ACLU's launch of People Power. [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org) stands for American Civil Liberties Union and their goal is to protect the rights of all Americans.

People Power is their response to the current political climate and their attempt to bring communities together across the nation at a grassroots level. We'll watch the Resistance Training live and talk about the steps needed to protect our basic freedoms and what this means to our community. The event will be held at the Skagway Public Library on March 11th @12:30pm. Please arrive a little before to ensure you can catch the beginning of the screening.

[RSVP on their website](http://go.peoplepower.org/event/attend/2077/?source=taf) so we know you're coming.

This event is not sponsored by the Skagway Public Library.

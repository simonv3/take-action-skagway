Skagway Assembly<br/>
700 Spring Street<br/>
P.O. Box 415<br/>
Skagway, AK 99840<br/>


Mr. Mayor and Assembly Members,

Our community would benefit from an official welcoming proclamation or resolution detailing our cityâ€™s commitment to maintaining a safe community open to all, embracing all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and religious beliefs.

The city of Skagway hosts over a million visitors every year and in a few short months, our small community will again experience the flood of seasonal workers, followed by thousands of international and national tourists, people of all colors, genders and orientations and people of all faiths. This is an opportune time to establish that our city values their presence and celebrates our joint diversity. To our knowledge, the municipality shares our belief that taking steps to foster inclusiveness on a local level will benefit all citizens, our children, our sense of community, and our country as we strive toward a common goal of diversity, equality, justice, and respect for all. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

> For an up-to-date list of signatures on the letter, see the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BR1SM4p3krHb1DhgNtzF_PNxTZfLLZrI8ATKfmelCQY/edit). There were 50 signatures last time we checked!
